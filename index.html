		<p><em class="highlight">Paperight was an award-winning experiment in distributed print-on-demand.</em> Our vision was 'Every book within walking distance of every home'. We set out to achieve this by turning ubiquitous photocopy shops into legal print-on-demand bookstores. Paperight ran for five years, worked with hundreds of shops, and listed thousands of books in its catalogue. Eventually, we couldn't make our approach self-sustaining, and decided to sunset our operations. We learned so much, and shared everything. We hope that others will make distributed print-on-demand a reality in other ways.</p>
